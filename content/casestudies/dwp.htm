	<h1>Department for Work and Pensions:  Developing a holistic policy to manage work pressure and stress in a  multi-faceted organisation </h1>
 
	<h2>
    Contact</h2>
	<p>Anne Donald – Head Office, Sheffield E-mail: anne.donald@jobcentreplus.gov.uk</p>
	<h2>
      Background</h2>
	<p>
	  The main  challenge facing DWP is that it is made up of a number of businesses with  various arrangements for managing stress or, as the Department prefers to call  it, uncomfortable work pressure. </p>
	<p>The Department  follows a similar pattern to other employers with stress being one of the  biggest causes of work related illness, and stress-related illnesses being the  most common cause of long term absenteeism. Approximately 21% of the  Department’s sick absence is due to mental ill health problems such as depression,  anxiety and nervous disability to which stress may have been a contributory  factor. </p>
	<p>To help develop  a coherent and generic policy for identifying and managing uncomfortable work  pressure, the Department has set up a working group with representatives from  each of its businesses and its trade unions. </p>
	<h2><strong>The initiative </strong> </h2>
	<p>The working group’s terms of reference were defined as: </p>
	<ul>
        <li>to steer the evaluation  and fact finding; </li>
        <li>to assist with the  development of a new core policy depending on the recommendations; and </li>
        <li>to participate in best  practice network groups to share with each other how they are implementing the  core policy in their own part of DWP. </li>
    </ul>
      <p>HSE-sponsored research by UMIST into Beacons  of Excellence in Stress Management identified two organisations - the  Employment Service and the Benefits Agency - both of which are now part of  DWP.  The working group decided to use  the good practices used in these two organisations, as well as other  organisations identified by the research, to help inform the development of a  department-wide policy. The working group and also the Senior HR Management  Team was also agreed that the HSE Management Standards for Stress will also be  used to help inform the policy that is developed. </p>
  
 
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>The working group  identified the following examples of good practice within DWP: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Managers being issued with  copies of HSE guidance on tackling 
          workplace stress. 
        </li>
        <li>Obtaining senior  management commitment to manage uncomfortable work pressure and ensuring they  attend in the early stages and check on attendance of their staff. </li>
        <li>Coaching of senior  managers to encourage them to consider their own working styles and attitudes  and how this might affect their behaviour towards others at work. </li>
        <li>Health screening with one-to-one  clinics for all employees within a particular part of the Department. The  health screening includes an anonymous stress audit (questionnaire on lap top  completed during session); information such as how stressed employees are; how  they cope with stress; likelihood of developing Coronary Heart Disease; and  suggested lifestyle amendments. The data is then analysed to assess the  prevalence of employees at risk from, for example, elevated cholesterol,  coronary heart disease, stress, alcohol abuse etc. The health issues identified  by the health screening determine future health promotion activity and  awareness raising. This includes stress awareness. </li>
        <li>Use of the Department’s  Employee Assistance Programme as an integral part of it’s managing attendance  and uncomfortable work pressure policies. </li>
        <li>Use of the annual staff  survey to provide a trigger and a context for discussing what is going well at  work as well as the barriers to a happy and productive working life and  possible solutions. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The next step is for the  policy to be drafted along with supporting procedures for the working group to  consider further. </p>
   
      <h2>Evaluation</h2>
       <p>To encourage continued  participation and enthusiasm, the work of the group is agreed one phase at a  time and is assessed at regular intervals to ensure its continued relevance and  usefulness. </p>
     <p>The group has recognised the importance of getting input from those  people who will have to implement any policies they come up with. To this end,  the group has set up an e-mail address through which employees can comment on  and contribute to the process.</p>
      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>In a large umbrella organisation such as DWP, developing a stress policy which complements the diverse priorities of numerous departments and agencies can be a daunting prospect. </p>
      <p>DWP have shown that a good first step is to involve all the relevant parties (senior management, employees, the unions) to consider good practices being used by other employers, establish what good practice exists within the various parts of the organisation and widen it to include the whole organisation.</p>
