	<h1>An example of a stress policy</h1>
 
	
	<h2>
      Introduction </h2>
	<p> We are committed to protecting  the health, safety and welfare of our employees and recognises that workplace  stress is a health and safety issue and acknowledge the importance of  identifying and reducing workplace stressors.</p>
	<p> This policy will apply to  everyone in the company and managers are responsible for implementation and the  company is responsible for providing the necessary resources. </p>
	
      <h2>Definition of  stress</h2>
      <p>
        The Health and Safety Executive define stress as “the adverse reaction  people have to excessive pressure or other types of demand placed on them”.  This makes an important distinction between pressure, which can be a positive  state if managed correctly, and stress which can be detrimental to health. </p>
      <h2>Policy </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>        The company will identify all workplace stressors and conduct risk <br />
          assessments to eliminate stress or control the risks from stress. These <br />
        risk assessments will be regularly reviewed.</li>
        <li>The company will consult with  Trade Union Safety Representatives on all proposed action relating to the  prevention of workplace stress. </li>
        <li>The company will provide training for all  managers and supervisory staff in good management practices. </li>
        <li>The company will provide  confidential counselling for staff affected by stress caused by either work or  external factors.</li>
        <li>The company will provide adequate resources to enable managers to  implement the company’s agreed stress management strategy. <br />
