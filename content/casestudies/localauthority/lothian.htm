    <h1>Lothian and Borders Fire and Rescue  Service</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The Lothian and Borders Fire and Rescue Service (LBFRS),  the worlds first municipal Fire Brigade (Edinburgh Fire Brigade, 1824),  currently serves approximately 890,000 people over 2,500 square miles in the  South East of Scotland. They employ 1,114 staff across their 36 local fire  stations and their administrative Headquarters based in Edinburgh.  </p>
    <p>The LBFRS provides both a proactive and reactive service  to the community.  Proactive work  includes safety checks in the home and the workplace and a variety of training  courses. Youth projects, school programmes and attendance by the LBFRS at local  events are also an invaluable part of this work.  The reactive work includes the traditional  and highly visible roles of firefighting, road traffic accident management and  rescue alongside the newly developed skills of advanced line rescue, urban  search and rescue, Ship firefighting and activities related to environmental and  terrorist risk.</p>
    <p>Also, the LBFRS are the first Fire and Rescue Service to  survey all their staff (whole population survey) using HSE’s Management  Standards for Work-related Stress.</p>
    <h2>Why a stress management initiative?</h2>
    <p>The LBFRS took part in a stress survey  in 2004, which was completed by a local University.  The results from this were inconclusive, but  the experience highlighted the value of a whole population survey.  In 2004 the organisation recognised that the  large number of changes occurring at a national level (UK) in the Fire  and Rescue Service could be having a detrimental impact on the well-being of  staff.</p>
    <h2>Why were the HSE Management Standards  chosen?</h2>
    <p>The HSE Management Standards were not  the only option available to LBFRS, with the Scottish ‘Work Positive’ approach  also a possible option. Whilst both methods were praised, the LBFRS selected  the HSE methodology for two reasons.   Firstly, it was believed that the support available from HSE via the  website would be extremely beneficial – the research documents and  reports.  Secondly, there are only eight  Fire and Rescue Services in Scotland.  This created a gamble in relation to future  benchmarking, as it was unclear whether the other Services in Scotland would, or would not use,  the Work Positive approach. The HSE approach was considered to be the preferred  option because, potentially, it would enable future benchmarking against the  other Fire and Rescue Services in the UK.   </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>‘The support from the HSE site is quite outstanding’</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Starting the process</h2>
    <h3>Getting ‘buy-in’</h3>
    <p>Work-related stress can be perceived as  a failure of management and rather than confront potential criticism many  organisations may shy from potential negative exposure, particularly in the  press. The LBFRS Joint Fire and Rescue Board [elected representatives], senior  managers and trade unions (Fire Brigades Union and UNISON) debated, honestly,  the subject and collectively accepted the need to protect their employee  population and members from this form of psychosocial workplace hazard. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>‘Each group had,  essentially, their own benevolent reasons to gauge the levels of work related  stress within the organisation to ensure the wellbeing of employees’</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This collective reasoning led to a  collective ‘buy in’ which, had there been any resistance, would have resulted  in failure to secure competent results. By communicating and involving all key  stakeholder groups the process was therefore endorsed and was given the  appropriate resource</p>
    <h3>The steering group</h3>
    <p>Existing working groups (including the  Revitalising Health and Safety Group) were utilised to form a steering group  for implementing the Management Standards initiative.  A number of stakeholders were involved in  these groups, including the Chief Fire Officer, The Assistant Chief Fire Officer,  Trades Union, Health and Safety, Occupational Health, FRS Medical Advisor and  Human Resources.</p>
    <h3>Training and support</h3>
    <p>Training on work-related stress was  provided for all senior managers including the Chief Fire Officer and trade  union officials.  The attendance of the  most senior people within the organisation gave weight to the whole process and  confirmed its relevance and the commitment of senior management. This was  delivered in the form of a one-day course at the FRS training facilities.  The Health and Safety Manager, the FRS  Medical Advisor, Clinical Psychologists and Occupational Psychologists all  assisted in the delivery of the training and a number of workshops. This  assisted with the wider buy-in from the organisation; recognition that trade union  and senior management collaboration. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>‘Once they had the [stress] course it was almost automatic buy-in  and perceptions were challenged and major wellbeing issues discussed’. All  understood that work-related mental ill health can be managed out of an  organisation’</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Other training and support included  providing every manager (Operational staff - Crew, Watch, Group and Brigade  Manager, Non Operational staff – all service delivery managers and functional  managers) with HSE’s ‘Real Solutions, Real People’ work-related stress packs.  The packs also included a CD produced by the LBFRS with additional resources  on, including the presentation slides from the training course. An e-learning  module on work-related stress was also available to staff.</p>
    <h3>Communication</h3>
    <p>Throughout the process the FBU and  Unison were kept informed and communication began with all staff very early on,  using existing seminars and e-mail.  The  Health and Safety (H&amp;S) Team at LBFRS identified that there was a stigma  attached to the term ‘stress’ within the Service.  In order to help overcome this a  comprehensive campaign of communicating to all staff was seen as essential.</p>
    <p>Communication with staff included using  existing seminars to discuss work-related stress and post-traumatic stress  disorder.  The minutes from the Health  and Safety Working Group meetings were also available to staff. </p>
    <h2>The process</h2>
    <h3>Use of existing data</h3>
    <p>Existing data was gathered in order to  assist with identifying the scale and extent of stress as an issue.   This data included sickness absence data;  return to work data and previous surveys conducted on well-being and  stress.  </p>
    <h3>The stress survey</h3>
    <p>The Management Standards Indicator Tool  was adopted in order to conduct a whole population survey. Prior to the  distribution of questionnaire, the LBFRS promoted the survey and raised  awareness by using their ‘in house’ magazine. The subject was raised as  business at all management meetings with managers directed to bring the survey  to the attention of all their staff.   E-mails were also sent to staff (all users), supported by trade union  officials, as an additional method to raise awareness about the survey. </p>
    <h3>Questionnaire distribution</h3>
    <p>Paper copies of questionnaires were  sent to all employees (both uniformed and non uniformed) at their home  addresses. This approach was favoured in an attempt to get a good response  rate.  It was thought that ‘questionnaire  fatigue’ might result in employees not completing the questionnaires if they  were sent to email addresses or given out at work.  Each member of staff was sent an envelope  which included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A covering letter from the Assistant  Chief Fire Officer</li>
      <li>The questionnaire</li>
      <li>A stamped addressed envelope</li>
      <li>A leaflet about counselling services  (bereavement, relationship problems, sexual health, financial problems, etc)  and services for post traumatic stress disorders</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The response rate for the survey was  39%, and although not ideal, this was relatively positive, as it was higher  than a number of other surveys used by LBFRS. </p>
    <h3>Data entry and analysis</h3>
    <p>The data entry <a name="ftnt1" id="ftnt1"></a><sup>[<a href="#footnotes">1</a>]</sup> was relatively human resource intensive and due to confidentiality issues, two  support staff in the Human Resource department were utilised to assist with  this task, thus ensuring confidentiality.   The analysis of the returns was then relatively easy by using the HSE  analysis tool.</p>
    <h3>Focus groups</h3>
    <p>The focus groups were conducted on a  relatively large scale, including approximately one half <a name="ftnt2" id="ftnt2"></a><sup>[<a href="#footnotes">2</a>]</sup> of the staff within the LBFRS.  The  groups were facilitated by Occupational Psychologists, Occupational Health  Nurses and a Medical Advisor. </p>
    <p>The results from the survey were used  in order to help guide the focus group discussions.  In some instances the key stressors for some  groups had changed since the time of the survey.  A feedback document will be produced and will  be made available to staff via the Intranet, site safety reps and Watch  Managers. </p>
    <h2>Action Planning </h2>
    <p>An action plan has been produced and a  number of the goals have been achieved.   A re-survey will be conducted in the near future in order to assist in  the evaluation of the strategy. This will be a sample survey, rather than  another whole population survey.   </p>
    <h2>Resource, costs and benefits</h2>
    <p>A significant amount of time was spent  by the Health and Safety Manager on running the Management Standards process.  Other time was needed from a variety of support staff (e.g. for data entry) and  other senior staff (e.g. to assist with training) and the Health and Safety  Team. Other external support was provided by Occupational Psychologists. The project  cost in total was approximately £40,000 to £50,000, which is largely the cost  associated with staff time. In relation to costs that did not include staff  time the figure is closer to £10,000 to £15,000. The benefits of running the  process did, however, far outweigh the costs.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>‘The main gain was a reduction in harm to the employee population  by confronting and managing work related stress. The resultant reduction in  absence due to work related stress made the whole exercise financially very  cost effective, making net fiscal savings over the period.’</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>The outcomes</h2>
    <p>The risk assessment process has not yet  been completed in LBFRS; however sickness absence rates have reduced  significantly.  From a financial  perspective, running the Management Standards has easily paid for itself  several times over. This saving can be seen by money saved by employees not  going on sick leave with stress alone.   Then there are also unknown savings, such as those from civil litigation  and increased efficiency of staff.  </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>‘It’s [the Management Standards] helped us help people whilst  saving public funds in terms of sickness absence due to stress ’</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Another benefit is that the  organisation now has a significantly higher awareness of issues surrounding  mental ill health.</p>
    <h2>Learning experience / advice to others</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>It is important to get top-level  management and trade union buy-in immediately </li>
      <li>Using professional project  management software may be beneficial for the overall project and action  planning and reporting</li>
      <li>Because of certain limitations of  the toolkit, the LBFRS undertook a cultural audit, to run in tandem with the  stress survey, (which included BME and LGB issues) within the organisation.  Without this facility, it would be very beneficial to include BME and LGB  fields to identify possible work related stressors from these minority groups</li>
      <li>Put a strategy in place for  dealing with Freedom of Information requests (particularly for public services)  when confidentiality has been assured to participants of the survey </li>
      <li>Be prepared that some  questionnaires may be returned with inappropriate comments on them that could  cause some upset</li>
      <li>Stress as an issue needs to be  explained properly to senior management, so that it is not seen by the  organisation as a weakness or a criticism of management ability</li>
      <li>Use independent people for the  focus groups, for example Occupational Health Nurses – this ensures that focus  groups leaders do not have an ‘agenda’ and that the issues can be raised openly  and freely</li>
      <li>Speak  to other organisations in your sector who have completed the process for  support and guidance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some poignant quotes from LBFRS:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>‘Our sickness absence  rates have plummeted’</em></p>
      <p><em>‘It [stress] is being  de-stigmatised’</em></p>
      <p><em>‘As a management method  to remediate these hazards it really is a worthwhile exercise’</em></p>
      <p><em>‘The HSE Standards  themselves are excellent’</em></p>
      <p><em>‘People are [now] more  open at management meetings to speak about the subject of stress’</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>‘The HSE Management Standards are easy to use –  by following the various steps an employer will easily identify the areas they  need to address. They also set reasonable targets to achieve over the medium  and long term. ’</p>
