    <h1>Rullion recruitment </h1>
	<img src="rullion5.gif" alt="Rullion recruitment logo" width="195" height="60" class="icaplr" />
    <h2>Stress Management</h2>
    <p>How do you get the Board of Directors to believe that stress management  is a requirement when absence figures are already below the national average  and the perception is that stress is not a problem……this was the challenge for  us!</p>
    <p>The Rullion Group consists of five businesses specialising in permanent  and temporary recruitment (employment business and agency).  The Group employs approx 300 employees in 27  offices across the UK,  and places approx 4500 temporary self employed workers in placements each  week.  The age diversity for our  workforce ranges from 18 to 63, although approximately half are under 30.  Annual turnover £220 million per annum.</p>
    <p>In general terms our absence record is good when compared to the  national statistics quoted by the CIPD in 2006:   8 working days lost per annum per employee (3.5% of working time).</p>
    <h3>Absence average comparisons</h3>
      <img src="rullion1.gif" alt="Absence average comparisons chart" width="600" height="427" />
    <p><img src="rullion2.gif" alt="Chart key" width="235" height="60" /></p>
    <p>For the Group as a whole, the average is 4.5 working days lost per  employee per annum (1.8% of working time).   </p>
    <p>The trend is very different if analysed by each of the 5 Group Companies:  The Co. with the worst absence level equates to 6.5 working days lost per  person per annum (2.7% of working time) and the Co. with the best absence  record averages at 1.7 working days lost per person per annum (0.7% of working  time).</p>
    <p>Having said all of this there is a cost to the absence we do have, and  our philosophy is that even if we are managing absence well, there is always  room for improvement.  We must strive to  ensure that our standards don’t slip otherwise complacency will facilitate poor  management practise and an increasing absence trend.  As there is clearly a variance in absence  levels between the different Companies in our Group this illustrates that there  is room for improvement in some areas. </p>
    <h3>      There were a number of factors that influenced our approach to stress as  follows:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Recruitment is a high  pressure, sometimes aggressive, fast moving and lucrative occupation, which can  be very stressful.  It is a people  centred industry and unreliability is a big issue.  It is also a very competitive sales  environment, because it is reactive to client need:  There is a very fast turnaround required and  often high demand.  The working hours are  also long, which can be tiring and difficult to manage, particularly for those  with families or other domestic commitments.  The personalities attracted to this type of  business are highly driven, motivated, fast moving individuals who are very  persuasive and assertive.  Many like an  adrenaline rush and thrive on their ‘highs’ but crash during their ‘lows’  making them very susceptible to stress related problems. </li>
      <li>Staff retention is a big  issue in the recruitment industry. When we evaluated our statistics it was  clear that we had a high turnover of staff with less than 2 years service.  In a high proportion of instances the exit  interview feedback reflected long working hours and other stressors such as  inability to cope with the sales environment, as the trigger for leaving.  </li>
      <li>On evaluation of the  causes for absence, we established that there was an increasing absence trend  regardless of cause, however stress and depression issues were becoming a more  common and regular occurrence.  There  were also a number of other types of absence that could be indicators of stress  related issues i.e. repeated migraines and IBS</li>
      <li>Finally, there were concerns  regarding litigation – our society is seeing increasing litigation and in  recruitment claims are becoming a more prominent feature, so it is essential  that we as a corporate body make every effort to protect our workforce and  therefore our business.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>We then faced a couple of major problems:</h3>
    <p>How could we change the perception of senior management in relation to  robust stress management?  How could we  make them see the benefits for the business?</p>
    <p>To senior management, the ‘S’ word conjured up images of litigation and  costly absence from work.  There was also  a belief that raising the profile of stress would encourage more staff to use  this as an excuse for taking time off.   There was very little understanding that  pressure can be a very positive motivator  (particularly in the sales arena) when managed carefully, or that pressure can  have the impact of driving an individual, maintaining their energy and  enthusiasm and consequently being a business benefit generating revenue for  both the business and the individual.   The critical factor is ensuring that pressure does not develop into a  ‘stressor’ where the person is unable to cope and feels burdened, unsupported  and de-motivated.</p>
    <p>Further consideration of this also made us realise that we would need to  start to change the culture of our organisation to really make a  difference.  This included persuading  management to drive change from the top, having a more flexible approach to  working time, considering role structures and staff support services. </p>
    <h3>So how did we approach these challenges?</h3>
    <p>The first thing was easy – drop the dreaded ‘S word’. When we read the  HSE’s Management Standards it was clear that the desirable performance in each  of the six standard areas related, not just to stress, but to good management  generally.  So we were able to progress  our ideas for ‘good management standards’ without the fear factor of the ‘S  word’.</p>
    <p>We published a stress management policy and to accompany this, some  guidance for our intranet so that we could raise awareness of stress and  improve understanding – this provided a baseline to build from.  We didn’t make this hard for ourselves though,  and used a stress policy template (thank you Croner!) which we developed and personalised  to our own business requirements.  We compiled  stress guidance using information from the HSE and NHS websites. </p>
    <p>We then prepared a ‘case study’ for our Board of Directors, to prove  that stress management works. We selected one of the Companies in the business  with higher absence trends and where stress was identified as a contributory  factor (therefore also a business risk) and used this as a test Company for our  ideas.  We investigated the causes and put  some stress management strategies in place.  </p>
    <h3>The process involved evaluating absence records in more detail.  So we looked at:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cause of       absences – identifying physical symptoms that could be symptomatic of       stress.</li>
      <li>Repeating       trends i.e. repeating symptoms either in groups of staff or individuals.       Absence patterns on any specific day of the week or month regularly taken       by a member of staff.   </li>
      <li>The frequency       of absences for individuals and groups  </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then we conducted general office and individual display screen equipment  training and risk assessments but we incorporated some additional questions in  the assessments to evaluate workplace stressors without highlighting that we  were researching ‘the S word’.  We did  this to try and establish whether there was any link between the symptoms and  trends we had found in the evaluation of absence records and to identify  whether there were environmental, ergonomic or work related issues that were  possibly contributing to stress levels.   A sample of the type of questions we included as detailed below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What do you       least enjoy about your work/workplace?</li>
      <li>What do you       most enjoy?</li>
      <li>Is there       anything that particularly irritates you or you dislike about your       workplace?</li>
      <li>If you could       change things at work, what would you change?</li>
      <li>Do you get       good support from your manager and colleagues?</li>
      <li>Do you ever       dream about work – if so how often and are these pleasant or unpleasant       dreams?</li>
      <li>Do you ever       take work home and if so how often?</li>
      <li>Do you look       forward to coming to work each day – if not why not?</li>
      <li>What effects       do you think your work has on your health if any?</li>
      <li>How often to       you take breaks during the day and for how long?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This allowed us to speak to staff and management to obtain honest  opinion, also to sample the work environment without any preconceived  expectations from the employees.  We felt it was important to spend time in the  workplace observing, without being seen to observe!  Often when people believe they are being  watched or tested their behaviour changes and when asked direct questions,  people will often give you a politically correct answer rather than an honest  one.  We therefore tried to make the  questions open, a little ambiguous and personal so that each person felt we were  interested in them and their opinions - which we were – and so that they could  get a feeling of involvement and control over their job and workplace, which  would be a good start to  identifying and  reducing workplace stressors.    </p>
    <p>The results were fed back to management as part of the risk assessment  findings, together with recommendations for improvements.  This included suggestions as simple as  reviewing the cable management in the workplace, improved communication and  consultation with staff, additional storage space as well as longer term more  complex recommendations such as revising job descriptions, installing  air-conditioning, considering new premises and a revised workplace layout.  Because the immediate recommendations were  simple to make and low cost, we obtained management approval to proceed with  the simpler solutions.  Remember:  Change doesn’t have to be complex or costly  and sometime the simplest solutions are the best. </p>
    <p>We introduced health assessment questionnaires for all staff to complete  and explained the purpose to everyone. This gave us better information about our  employees and in particular those who might have pre-existing or historical  health conditions that may put them more at risk in the workplace as a result  of their health.  Subsequently we were  able to undertake appropriate individual risk assessments for those at most  risk which made the staff feel valued, and allowed us to make reasonable  adjustments in the workplace where required.</p>
    <p>The introduction of an Employee Helpline, external to the organisation,  and facilitating confidential, impartial advice and counselling was perceived  very positively by staff and management.   This also enabled the Group to provide a robust mechanism for supporting  employees and their families in the event of an assortment of issues, which we  hoped would help reduce worry regarding work and/or non work related issues  that may contribute to stress levels and other related ill health.</p>
    <p>A private healthcare scheme run by the Company was expanded (subject to qualifying  criteria) so that many more employees and their immediate families had private  cover enabling them to obtain health assistance immediately if required.</p>
    <p>An absence reporting process was introduced, providing a confidential  report to the Group Chairman.  The report  provides information regarding any employee where a single absence extends over  10 days or where there are on-going health issues. The Health and Safety  Manager contacts all these employees personally to provide support and to risk  assess the impact of work on the employee’s health.  Advice and input from medical practitioners  is imperative to ensure understanding and the correct approach is taken.</p>
    <p>The Chairman reviews the report with the HR team on a monthly basis, to  ensure that appropriate corporate support is provided such as extended sick  pay, support with private health costs, occupational health support; phased  rehabilitation into the workplace etc.  </p>
    <p>To complement the major changes there were some supporting activities  such as posters, a staff newsletter, staff consultation, and staff suggestion  schemes etc. to help communicate change and encourage participation from staff.</p>
    <h3>So….did it work?</h3>
    <p>As you can imagine it took more than a year to implement and develop the  changes.  During this time we monitored  our absence figures in the case study company and we found that whilst staff  numbers had increased, absence figures had started to decrease and productivity  had increased.  Staff retention had  started to stabilised although it was too early to tell whether there was a  trend toward improvement within the first 2 years of employment (we are  monitoring this).  </p>
    <h3>RCP Staff absence may 05 - May 06 </h3>
    <p><img src="rullion3.gif" alt="RCP Staff absence may 05 - May 06" width="600" height="405" /></p>
    <p><img src="rullion4.gif" alt="Chart key" width="169" height="90" />  </p>
    <p>      It was time to present the case study to the management team: So a  presentation was prepared, illustrating our aims, the process, the outcomes and  suggestions to progress this further. …….   It worked.  The management team  could see the benefit and between us we devised a strategy for further  improvement focussing not just on stress but on good working practise  generally.  This started with:</p>
    <p>A wellbeing and productivity survey:   a random selection of staff were asked to document all their activities  for a week – including rest breaks, food and drink consumed and work  activities.  The results were evaluated  to establish trends i.e.  Who was getting  the best results in the shortest working time, how were they achieving this and  what management support was provided?  We  also looked at those people working long hours and considered how this affected  their stamina and productivity.  Which  staff were taking reasonable breaks? Who was eating and drinking in a healthy  way and how this was affecting performance.</p>
    <p>From the results we were able to provide good practise feedback to the  individuals on how to improve their performance and work in a healthier  way.  Staff also gave us their feedback  on what changes they thought were needed and what impact the changes were  making for them as individuals – they were so much more motivated and  enthusiastic.  Staff willingness to  communicate had improved and the working atmosphere was lighter and more  energetic.  Already we were witnessing  positive change.  </p>
    <p>This provided valuable feedback to management to enable them to plan  further improvements.  This included  staff training, exchange of good practise ideas, structuring working practises  to get the best from staff, staff mini presentations on how they achieve,  encouraging frequent short breaks and shorter but more standard working hours  and improved welfare arrangements.</p>
    <h3>      This is still a work in progress but we have commenced a programme for:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Reviewing all       job roles and structures</li>
      <li>A revised       staff training programme</li>
      <li>More staff       interaction </li>
      <li>A feedback       survey to evaluate staff perception of changes to date</li>
      <li>A move to new       offices</li>
      <li>A stress       evaluation questionnaire, to allow us to provide intervention and support       for any vulnerable employee.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Progress is slow at times, it does need driving by the Health and Safety  and HR teams to encourage management change, but it is working and is a  learning curve for everyone.  It is  important for the health and safety professionals to exercise a listening ear,  not just for staff but also for management, taking into account the commercial  objectives with industry requirements and expectations, then, adapting any  suggestions to provide a balanced and democratic approach avoiding  inflexibility.  This has been a big step  for management and to their credit they have embraced this wholeheartedly.</p>
    <p>The next step is to progress this process across the rest of the Group  and we know we will continue to reap the benefits of good management practise  reflecting the requirements of good stress management techniques as illustrated  in the HSE standards. </p>
