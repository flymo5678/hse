    <h1>Fosters Primary School   </h1>
    <h2>Executive summary </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>This case study is about a one  and a half Form Entry Primary School with a full foundation stage in one of the  outer London Boroughs. </li>
      <li>The school began the Well-Being  Programme in spring 2004. The Programme has raised awareness of the need to  include all staff and the need for clarity about changing roles and  responsibilities. </li>
      <li>This case study focuses on the  processes in place to ensure all staff are included in the school’s  communication systems. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Contextual  information  </h2>
    <p>      This  school has undergone dramatic changes in the past decade. The old Victorian  building has been replaced with a modern well-appointed building. A well-resourced  purpose designed area has been established for the Foundation Stage and the  children have designed a ‘senses’ environmental area at the front of the school  (achieving Bexley in Bloom’s ‘Best School Frontage in 2003’). <br />
      The  Ofsted Inspection in 2002 praised the hard work, which had been needed to turn  the school round from special measures in 1998. There were no major weaknesses  identified for action. For three consecutive years (1999-2002) the school has  received the School Achievement Award for improved standards. </p>
    <p>      The  current Management Team have been appointed through internal promotions, which  indicates the confidence the staff and governors have in their ability to  continue to build the school’s effectiveness. Until this last year, the teaching  staff have been stable for the past five years. In common with other London schools, change  has been with overseas trained teachers returning home. Members of the support  staff have been at the school for the longest time and have experienced the  changes outlined above. Pupil mobility is minimal with the exception of the  current year 6. </p>
    <h2>The  process to date  </h2>
    <p>      The  Deputy Head teacher attended the Well-Being briefing meeting and recommended to  the Head that for a minimal outlay the school could be involved in a worthwhile  programme. </p>
    <p>      Completing  the OSRM and raising the level of awareness of the aspects of wellbeing at  individual and organisational level resulted in the Head and Deputy discussing  a review of the communication systems. </p>
    <h2>The  outcomes to date  </h2>
    <h3>Improved communication  </h3>
    <p>      The  Leadership team wanted coherent and inclusive systems in place, understood by  all to ensure a good level of communication in the school. They set up a cycle  of meetings to ensure this: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Teaching staff now have a weekly  meeting. </li>
      <li>Senior  Management Team (SMT) meet on Thursdays with the flexibility to change to  Wednesdays for a part time member of the team. </li>
      <li>A diary  meeting for all on Fridays while a member of SMT takes an assembly. </li>
      <li>Support staff  have a formal meeting half-termly. Their co-ordinator is the Well-Being  Facilitator along with the Deputy, so any interim issues can also be raised at  SMT meetings. One of the support staff is also the link for the midday staff,  as she holds both roles. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Other methods to improve communications include the  following: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Notice boards  are used well for communication. A board in the staff room records daily events  and has a section to communicate requests for resources etc. The midday staff have  a ‘special eye’ board with children, which raises awareness on a range of  topics relating to health and behaviour. </li>
        <li>Teachers and  Teaching Assistants (TAs) have a book kept just outside the classroom for  administrative tasks. This also supports the Remodelling Programme and helps to  resource children’s learning. </li>
    </ul>
      <h3>Communication  on change </h3>
      <p>        The school also wished to raise levels of communication  concerning the direction of the school. They wanted to ensure different  sections of the school community were engaged in the process. It was agreed  that the most effective method would be to have at least two reviews of the  School Development Plan (SDP) throughout the course of the year. It was felt  that this would involve all the different staff groups and help them to  understand how their roles impact on the bigger picture. </p>
      <h3>        Roles and  responsibilities </h3>
      <p>        The support staff raised the issue of roles and  responsibilities needing to be clarified. In response to their concern, this  issue is currently being discussed. The SMT are aware that they will need to  revisit and engage with the issue over a period of time as the discussions and  implementation of Remodelling takes its course. The co-ordinator of the TAs is  very committed to the Well-Being Programme and to the school. She has said that  the reason she has been at the school for 16 years is that it is a “very good  school”. </p>
      <h2>        The future </h2>
      <p>        Inducting new staff into the way communication works at this  primary school is being addressed through the mentorship of Newly Qualified  Teachers (NQTs) and other new staff by members of the SMT. This is overseen by  an Advanced Skills Teacher (AST) who has responsibility for NQT mentoring and  aspects of their training. </p>
      <p>        The school is very positive about the outcomes of the  Well-Being Survey and intends to continue to a second year so that staff feel  they have another way of recording their perceptions about the areas of  strengths and development for themselves and the organisation. </p>
