    <h2 class="utilclearfloats">Contextual information  </h2>
    <p>      Thomas Tallis School  is a comprehensive school in Greenwich,  southeast London.  The school has a mixed-ability intake. <br />
      In the  school’s 2002 Ofsted inspection, the school was described as follows: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>“Thomas  Tallis is a very effective school where standards of teaching, learning,  leadership and management are very high. Students’ attainment in the GCSE  examinations is above the national average and is improving.  </em></p>
      <h2><em>What  the school does well: </em></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Students make very good progress through Years 10  and 11, so that standards of attainment in the GCSE examinations are steadily  rising </em></li>
        <li><em>The school is successfully raising standards in  literacy and numeracy in Year 9 </em></li>
        <li><em>It provides very good teaching </em></li>
        <li><em>All students have very good access to appropriate  educational opportunities </em></li>
        <li><em>The school benefits from very good leadership and  management </em></li>
      </ul>
      <h2><em>What  could be improved:</em></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Levels of attendance </em></li>
        <li><em>The quality of the accommodation” </em></li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Continuous  self-evaluation and development was already a key feature of this school and  the management felt that the Well-Being Programme would provide an invaluable  tool to gather the views of school staff. </p>
    <p>      Thomas  Tallis’s Well-Being Programme has been championed by Douglas Greig, Assistant  Head, who is the member of the senior leadership team responsible for  facilitating the process in the school and leading the Well-Being team. Douglas was the point of contact for this case study. </p>
    <h2>The Well-Being process so far  </h2>
    <p>      In the  summer of 2003, the DfES Teacher Retention Unit agreed to fund 15 local  authorities (involving a total of 378 schools) to pilot the Well-Being  Programme in London.  Thomas Tallis joined the programme as part of this initiative. </p>
    <p>      The  survey response rate has been very good for a school of this size (60% in Phase  1 and 63% in Phase 2) and receiving encouragement to complete the OSRM online  has given staff a strong sense of purpose. To demonstrate how important the  online audit was considered, the school allocated a specific slot of time for  staff to complete the survey during a training day and the whole process was  facilitated by Douglas and his team. The fact that the second response rate was  higher than the first reflects how seriously Well-Being has been taken within  the school. </p>
    <p>In each phase, after the school’s  Well-Being team received initial feedback of the data, the findings were  presented to the whole staff. Individuals were then invited to contribute their  ideas for development. From these discussions, the Well-Being team was able to  draw up an action plan, which was subsequently included in the School  Improvement Plan. </p>
    <p>      Thomas Tallis has remained on the  Well-Being Programme following the end of the London pilot and began Phase 3 in Autumn Term  2006. </p>
    <h2>      Key outcomes to  date </h2>
    <p>      Following whole-staff feedback and  discussion of the OSRM data, the following areas emerged as priorities for  action at Thomas Tallis School: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ease of  movement around the school </li>
      <li>Physical  surroundings in the classrooms </li>
      <li>Security </li>
      <li>Admin and IT  support </li>
      <li>Systems for  conflict resolution </li>
      <li>Communication  between staff </li>
      <li>The perceived  ‘gap’ between SLT and staff </li>
      <li>Links between  teams </li>
      <li>Worklife  balance </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Douglas feels that the  Well-Being Programme has provided the following benefits to the school and the staff: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Participation  in the programme has been a very positive experience as it has reinforced a  culture of self-evaluation that underpins much of the development work already  taking place </li>
      <li> Staff  wellbeing is now a regular agenda item at staff meetings; and the number of  staff meetings has increased as a direct result of the feedback from the OSRM </li>
      <li> In what has  been an exceptionally challenging term in the teaching profession (TLRs, SEFs  etc.), the programme has provided an extremely effective and constructive  method of channelling some high emotions amongst the staff </li>
      <li> The  information provided by the OSRM has been invaluable. Issues which could  otherwise have gone unnoticed and/or unresolved were identified at an early  stage, enabling the Senior Leadership Team to act on them. For example, as a  result of the discussions surrounding the Well-Being data, one tier of  management was identified as not working as effectively as it might. The  Well-Being Programme enabled the school to pinpoint this issue, which gave the  SLT a tremendous headstart in resolving the issue </li>
      <li> The  Well-Being Programme has provided a powerful focal point around which support  staff and teaching staff have been able to work together positively and  constructively </li>
      <li> The process  has helped with the school’s re-accreditation to IiP </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Any problems  encountered? </h2>
    <p>      There were a few administrative challenges  in setting the programme up in such a large school. </p>
    <h2>      In summary </h2>
    <p>      Participating in the Well-Being Programme  has been a very positive experience for the school’s staff and the benefits  have been tremendous. “The information we’ve received is so important. Cost is  not an issue - the programme is great value for money”.</p>
