    <h1><strong>Shaftesbury</strong><strong> High School</strong><strong> for Special Needs</strong></h1>
    <h2>Executive summary  </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>This  case study is about a special school for children between 11-17 with complex  learning difficulties. </li>
      <li>The school completed its second  Organisational Self-Review Measure (OSRM) in January, as part of the London  Pilot. This study focuses on the links they have made with their existing  practice, IiP, the Healthy Schools programme, workforce Remodelling and ongoing  school self-evaluation. </li>
      <li>The school’s aim is to link these  different perspectives, both statutory and non-statutory, to meet the needs of  the individuals and the organisation. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Contextual  information  </h2>
    <p>      The  following achievements of the school reflect the school’s focus on staff  development and staff health: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Two school achievement awards.  The only school in the Borough to achieve two. </li>
      <li>Successfully re-assessed for IiP  this term and Healthy Schools accreditation. </li>
      <li>Accredited for City and Guilds  NVQ 2 and 3. Training provider for Graduate Teacher Programme (GTP). </li>
      <li>A large programme to improve the  physical environment had been completed. </li>
      <li>A school counsellor who is able  to facilitate staff/parent meetings and be available for staff. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The  Head teacher saw that joining the Well-Being Programme was another way to  reflect on the current practices within the school and help to inform the  strategic way forward for the school. He felt that while they had well-established  support mechanisms in place, the Programme including the Employee Assistance  Line, would give another point of contact for staff. One of the strengths of  the Programme in his view, was that it is voluntary and non-statutory, and  focuses on staff in a way which complements IiP, Healthy Schools  and workforce Remodelling. </p>
    <p>      The time  between Phase 1 and Phase 2 has seen significant changes for staff e.g. changes  to the school day which have impacted on meetings and how they manage their  time. </p>
    <h2>The  process to date  </h2>
    <p>      All work  throughout the Well-Being Programme has been supported by a process of  consultation and communication about changes that have been made and are  planned for future implementation. This process is supported by the Well-Being  Facilitator. The Facilitator is a member of the support staff and a staff  governor and has also become a member of the school’s management team since she  began her role in the Well-Being Programme. </p>
    <p>      The good  informal social structures in the school also support these changes and have  helped staff, including the leadership team, through a difficult time for the  school. This was a time when the Head teacher considered that their fundamental  professional judgments were being challenged. These existing structures - a  meeting for staff to air their strong feelings and the awareness raised by the  Programme – have contributed to acknowledging the staff’s needs. </p>
    <p>      The  feedback from the first OSRM indicated that getting a better work-life balance  and improving aspects of communication were the priorities from the staff. The  OSRM for Phase 2 coincides with the school’s Development Plan review so that  outcomes can be incorporated in the school’s strategic plan. </p>
    <h2>The outcomes to date  </h2>
    <p>      Through  discussion and in response to solving identified issues related to managing  pupils’ needs and creating space for meetings, there was consultation with all  stakeholders to change the timing and format of the school day. Principles were  agreed such as split lunch breaks for Key Stage 3 and 4 pupils, and the need  for an extra-curricular end of school activity which the pupils enjoyed and  were totally engaged in. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The working day from September 2004  changed to 8.30-14.30. Extra curricular activities 14.30–15.10. </li>
      <li>Two days a week staff do extra  curricular activities and use the time on the other three days for their own  work. Teachers have 12.5% non-teaching time and Teaching Assistants (TAs) have  two lessons for planning and preparation. </li>
      <li>Two days a week are scheduled for  meetings from 15.15-16.00. </li>
      <li>Pupils come straight to classrooms in  the morning and have split lunch breaks (KS3, KS4). </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Changes  have been made to the original plan in response to staff raising issues since  implementation. The issue of co-ordinator time and Planning Preparation and Assessment  (PPA) time is still to be addressed for implementation in September 2005. A  positive impact on staff is the control they have over managing their time on  the two days their contact time finishes at 14.30. </p>
    <h2>The wider impact of  the Programme  </h2>
    <p>      Prior  to joining the Well-Being Programme the staff were a mutually caring group, who  readily provided support for each other. The Programme clearly endorsed this  and encapsulated the leadership team’s personal beliefs that it is important to  support people at all times and especially when life is difficult. </p>
    <h2>The future  </h2>
    <p>      The  Head teacher is looking to consult staff on ways to further address workload  issues and work-life balance during their time in school. The Head teacher will  also include himself in his discussions with governors. The outcomes of the  Phase 2 OSRM will be both a comparison with Phase 1 and give the school the  opportunity to move on in addressing longer term solutions to staff wellbeing. </p>
