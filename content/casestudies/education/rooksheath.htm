    <h1>Rooks Heath High School</h1>
    <h2>Executive summary  </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>This  case study is about a 12-16 High School in an outer London Borough with 986  pupils sharing its site with First and Middle schools. It is in phase one in  the London Pilot of the Well-Being Programme. </li>
      <li>The school has applied for  Business and Enterprise  specialist status. </li>
      <li>The focus of this study is the  recognition of different priorities for different groups of staff and  everyone’s involvement in their solution. </li>
      <li>An example of working on  wellbeing issues as an intrinsic part of school development is an annual joint  training day organised by the school manager which includes all staff at both  this school and the feeder schools (400 staff in total). </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Contextual  information  </h2>
    <p>      While the  Headteacher felt that his staff had a voice and were involved in all the  school’s processes, he saw the merit of being involved in the Well-Being Pilot  as a further indicator and affirmation of his perception. He also considered  that it would link with the work the school is doing as a pilot school for  workforce reform. </p>
    <p>      The  school has a high number of casual admissions. For example by the October  half-term 2004 there had been 50 pupils admitted across the school. 50% of the  pupils have English as their second language and 52% have special needs. To  help cater for these needs, the school is working with other agencies on site  to extend its role in the community. </p>
    <p>      In 2003  the school celebrated an increase of 5% in A*-C GSCE passes. </p>
    <p>      The joint  INSET day, its organisation and its aim to meet the needs of all staff, has  been in place for the last 3 years. The courses and training offered cover  aspects of wellbeing and other related school topics. </p>
    <h2>The  process to date  </h2>
    <p>      The  school completed the Well-Being Organisational Self Review Measure (OSRM) in  January 2004 and received a good response rate from the 102 staff at the  school. </p>
    <p>      The areas  perceived to be a priority, reflecting all the different groups of staff were: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improving the physical  environment </li>
      <li>Making better use of resources </li>
      <li>Work overload </li>
      <li>Managing change </li>
      <li>Career progression for middle  management </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Staff  were invited to a meeting to receive the Commentary feedback and a copy of the  whole report was given to everyone. Following the initial briefing at the staff  meeting, staff split into working groups to discuss their five priorities. Feedback from the working  groups was given to all staff and the information displayed in the staff room.  The feedback was used to develop an action plan. </p>
    <p>      It was evident at this stage that there were some ideas that  could be implemented quickly and this was actioned. The next stage was for the  feedback to be discussed in the various working groups who were writing the  School Development Plan (SDP). It was seen as important to incorporate the  major action points in the Three Year Plan. </p>
    <p>      It is the policy that the whole school including the  governors are involved in this process. There are 16 staff working groups and  each group was given the lists of actions for one to two priorities. Groups  then included what they felt was relevant to the SDP. The governors were also  part of this process as the Leadership team are keen that there is an  opportunity for everyone to be involved in this key process. </p>
    <h2>      The outcomes to date </h2>
    <p>      A wellbeing page has been included in the SDP. Wellbeing is  included in the other aspects of the plan and will be used as one of the  criteria to evaluate the plan. </p>
    <p>      The Facilitators and the Leadership team feel that there is a  correlation between increasing staff morale and their wellbeing. The following  have been put into place as a response to the Well-Being Programme: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Refreshments  or breakfast are provided at the start of a training day, with lunch on most  days and fruit is available for staff at break times. Food is also available on  parents’ evenings. </li>
      <li>The meeting  structure has been reviewed so all staff can contribute. </li>
      <li>The school’s  philosophy is “We listen to what staff say and take action”. </li>
      <li>The annual  cluster training-day included wellbeing sessions last year. These were stress  management, conflict resolution and work/life balance. More topics are to be  included in the 2005 programme. </li>
      <li>A key feature  of the school is to include all staff in their school and value their role. An  example of this has been the renaming of support staff as associate staff. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The future </h2>
    <p>      The school will continue implementing their agreed plans in  the second year of the Programme. The medium and longer term will be reviewed  as an outcome of the second OSRM in spring 2005. New staff appointed since the  last OSRM will be included. A positive outcome has been the focus on staff and  what matters to them. A strand dedicated to wellbeing has also been included in  the school’s consultative processes towards their strategic planning. </p>
    <p>      The practice of having an annual cluster day is an excellent  example of the Well-Being process in action. It is inclusive, consultative and  responsive to staff needs. It is a large undertaking that is appreciated by all  staff and eagerly looked forward to. Staff from the different schools have  requested for their next cluster day topics including mental health, stress,  relaxation and anger management; and also activities such as sports, arts and  crafts, and cookery. </p>
    <p>      This one annual activity shows the school’s philosophy of  including staff in all processes in action. It complements the processes and  protocols in all the other aspects of the school.</p>
