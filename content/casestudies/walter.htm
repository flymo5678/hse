	<h1>Stress,  mental health and rehabilitation – one man’s story</h1>
 
	
	<p>I write this brief, personal case study as a health and  safety practitioner, in the hope that it may be of interest to others.</p>
	<p>
    I had my first breakdown in 1997 (when I was 37), and my  second two years later in 1999. Up until then my life had been relatively  uneventful, more or less ordinary. It had followed a familiar pattern: school,  university, further qualifications, kept fairly fit, healthy, hobbies, cycling,  drama, writing, got married had children, grandparents died. My life was  normal. At least as normal as life ever is. </p>
	<p> The first time, it built up slowly, over a few months. Some  of the events leading up to the breakdown are interesting, and were significant  for me.  But they wouldn’t necessarily  be significant to anyone else. As well as relationship issues at home, factors  included the constant pressure to meet deadlines, lunch only being a hurried  sandwich at the desk. On one occasion, I took what most would regard as a  ‘minor conflict’ with a senior manager at work (over a stress research project  no less!) as a major, personal insult and this blew the lid off everything for  me.</p>
	<p>
    It was May 1997, the day the IRA brought the country to a  standstill with bomb hoaxes, just before the election. From then on life began  to race wildly. I was on a high. My behaviour began to change. Gradually, more  people realised that there was something wrong. At first, as far as I was concerned,  I was having one of the best times of my life - I had so much creative energy.  Ideas would come flooding in and I wanted to do everything, all at once. I was  experiencing mania and later delusions as the ideas became further removed from  reality, and towards the end profoundly disturbing. This all took place over  the space of six to eight weeks. During the last few days I really wasn’t  making sense. I met with my manager and his boss in a relaxed environment  outside of work, and they diplomatically recommended (based on the erratic and  unusual behaviour over preceding weeks) that I rest and see a doctor. By this  time they had realised something was seriously wrong. Confused, at the doctors,  I was recommended for psychiatric care and, on being admitted I broke down  completely: I had experienced ‘an acute psychotic episode’. </p>
	<p> There were various further diagnoses: bipolar affective  disorder (manic depression) stress-related illness, schizo-affective disorder,  to name but a few. The symptoms were mixed, unclear. I began to recover in  hospital during my first week, with medication. Medication! ‘One Flew Over the  Cuckoo’s Nest’ had put me off ‘medication’ for life!! I was in hospital for a  month, and off work for three months altogether. During that time even the  first, brief visit by a very caring personnel officer, on neutral ground (a  coffee shop near home - even the thought of a journey into London upset me),  had me in tears for no reason. Everybody was very supportive, my employer, my  manager and my work colleagues. I was the one worrying how people would take  it, what I would say. How could I explain something that I didn’t  understand?  </p>
	<p> Importantly, the rehabilitation involved a gradual return to  work. It was a well-managed process. For instance, after meeting with the  personnel manager the first time, I met with both her and my line manager,  again on neutral territory for coffee in an hotel. It helped just to talk about  work and how to best phase me back in. With my consent, as well as obtaining general  occupational health advice, my personnel manager would discuss my welfare with  my consultant psychiatrist - not the detail of my illness, but the practical  things to help ease me back into work. At every stage the options were also  discussed and agreed with me. We talked about the job, likes, dislikes,  strengths and weaknesses, but there was no pressure to change. However, at our  first, brief planning meeting while I was off work, in spite of the informal  conversation in restful surroundings, I was still very tense and anxious.  Although I was lucid intellectually, emotionally I felt very sensitive,  vulnerable. After I had been off work for three months the rehabilitation  involved being phased back in gently over a further three months: a few hours,  a few days at a time to three and fours days a week. Initially, I would arrive  at work later and leave earlier. This would help counteract the sleepiness  caused by the medication in the mornings and also help to avoid the usual  pressures of rush hour.  </p>
	<p> First the return to work was just for me to visit, to be  there to meet colleagues, to talk, to feel accepted. It was a case of just  getting used to being back in the office again, with no expectation on me to  answer calls, for example. At the start I was more closely supervised, and  frequently and informally met with my manager and personnel manager. Gradually,  still on medication and under the supervision of my consultant psychiatrist,  the work increased until after two or three months I could cope with a more  normal workload. The job was also redesigned in part to broaden the work to  more closely match some of my concerns and interests. The whole process of a  phased return to work helped to rebuild my confidence and to confirm my  capability.</p>
	<p>
    However, it seemed a long time to get back up to strength. I  carried on taking tablets for a year. The second breakdown, in May 1999, took  everyone by surprise. It happened very quickly, beginning from the moment I  woke up, away from home, on a day I was to be lecturing a small class on a  course. Increasingly things seemed different, strange. I became afraid, out of  all proportion to the usual pre-presentation nerves. I entered another  frightening and deluded world. Two days later I was back in the same hospital.  A few more days, more tablets and I was sane again. I was keen to return to  work, to get back to normality as soon as possible. This time I was only out of  work for a month.  </p>
	<p>The same consultative step by step approach was taken to  phasing me back in. Underlying the pressures at work had been tensions in my  home life. There were several sources of stress and there was much left  unresolved. It has taken me many months of therapy to realise what I had tried  to ignore and I’ve yet to find all the answers. Even now, years later, I  sometimes feel as if I’m still going through a form of rehabilitation. I have  experienced what I would describe as minor blips, although two required a  further week in hospital on each occasion.  </p>
	<p>I have to continuously monitor my feelings and experiences  for any irregularities and ensure with my manager that I keep a manageable  workload. I remain in contact with my consultant psychiatrist and therapist to  ensure the best treatment.
    </p>
	<h2>Risk assessment  </h2>
	<p>While I believe that employers need to carry out risk  assessments in the interests of mental health, this is as much of an art as a  science. For example it is important that managers are able to recognise signs  of stress and have some understanding of possible ill-health outcomes.  It is also vital that they are able to  communicate effectively, including being able to listen to distressed  individuals, as well as being equipped with the more practical skills of  carrying out a risk assessment.</p>
	<p> It is only remotely possible that even a specialist, with  considerable time at their disposal, could have had any chance of identifying  that I was likely to breakdown the first time around. There were pressures of  course, from myself, from home, from work, but even I didn’t really appreciate  them. However, there were signs that people especially those close to me had  begun to recognise for instance in terms of the mania, the racing energy and  increasingly grandiose ideas. There do need to be systems and procedures in  place at work, to minimise the risk of pressures creating stress, and leading  to ill health. Managers and employees have to know what precautions can  help. </p>
