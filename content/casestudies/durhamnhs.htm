    <h1>County Durham  and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Approximately 6000 employees  situated across Durham and Darlington,  with 4 main hospital sites. In January 2005 their former Occupational Health  Physician had advanced warning of SIP1 and signed up the Trust so they were on  the list from the beginning.</p>
    <p>Before this they realised they  had to do something, and H&amp;S and the Staff Counselling Service were in the  process of putting something together.</p>
    <p>They had already arranged a  steering group and done some preliminary work which was “crucial” – without  this starting from scratch would have been very difficult.</p>
    <h2>Steering group </h2>
    <p>In a sense, senior management  commitment was provided by the steering group - chaired by the Director of  Estates and Facilities. Unions were a key player in this but in practice found  it very difficult to get release of staff – so a major struggle to get meetings  fully attended (but this is a general problem – not just stress work – reflects  general pressures). Key aspects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Buy-in from staff side after various presentations       given to unions (RCN, UNISON) – they then signed an agreement to       participate and to get employee involvement – they were keen to do this       and very happy to support.</li>
      <li>Input from communications manager (a former       journalist) whose expertise was very valuable but at a premium because the       Trust was going for foundation status. The size and fragmentation of the       Trust made communications strategy difficult. Various media were used       (flyer/leaflet/night shifts contacted/e-mail/bulletins/staff newspaper and       the branch meeting and consultative committee were also involved).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Data gathering</h2>
    <p>Used the HSE methodology. Questionnaire made up of  demographic information and a question set was attached to employee pay slips,  as a lot of things are. The response rate reduced as a consequence –  approximately 1800/6000.</p>
    <p>Some sickness absence data was  gathered, as was data from the Occupational Health Department and Counselling  Service.</p>
    <p>All of this data was sent back to  the steering group for consideration. A major problem was that there was not  enough reflection time – things were very rushed – &quot;should we use focus  groups?&quot;, &quot; who should be in them?&quot;, &quot;what are the key groups?&quot;. </p>
    <h2>Focus groups</h2>
    <p>These have been most successful</p>
    <ul>
      <li>At first struggled to get attendees – &quot;favours&quot;       were called in to fill early groups. This generated momentum so later       sessions were attended by many willing and interested staff.</li>
      <li>Had 120 attendees so experimented to get make-up       right – split junior/middle/senior; some mixed; some site specific.</li>
      <li>Peer group ones best – common experience and       similar problems.</li>
      <li>Comment – this is the first time in the Trust where       we feel we have a “voice”. The opportunity to speak out and say “radical       things” was very much appreciated because it was done in a way “not done       before”.</li>
      <li>Difficulty to get clinical staff because of       workload.</li>
      <li>Facilitator recruitment (originally 12) was done       via the steering group who were asked to recommend good listeners.       Recruitment of facilitators and participants may have been best achieved       through a “global” e-mail but there were restrictions against these.</li>
      <li>ACAS did a two-day training for facilitators, which       went down very well. Most people learnt a great deal. The facilitators       were taken from a huge range of backgrounds. This required the line       manager’s co-operation.</li>
      <li>Approach – one person facilitates one focus group       and acts as a scribe for another but must have time to prepare and then to       write up notes (the latter may take several days).</li>
      <li>PLANNING is absolutely critical in such a large       organisation. Booking rooms, sending out invitations etc dictated when the       focus groups could run.</li>
      <li>Format – every group had the same lead off question       “what is it like to work in this Trust” then split according to six HSE       risk areas – different issues for different groups – one per group –       results varied.</li>
      <li>Data from flip charts transcribed onto proformas to       aid action planning – done by scribes then e-mailed to steering group –       could be a bit of a struggle to capture everything in focus groups – this       depended upon facilitator expertise and composition of groups – some just       wanted to “whinge” and were not as useful.</li>
      <li>Twenty-four (24) sets of notes fed back to steering       group based on questions and notes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Action plan</h2>
    <p>The output from the focus groups has lead to action plans  for trust-wide adoption for common themes and plans for sub-groups. A huge  range and array of actions some devolved down to named individuals to take  forward asking them “What do you think, what might be the timescale, can it be  done?”. Some extra work has been done with specific departments where difficult  issues have arisen. Focus groups have been held in 4 Directorates, and 2  Directorates used the ACAS “FAST” system (Facilitated Analysis and Solution  Tool) – an electronic “chat room” run like a focus group. This was highly  successful in 1 Directorate.</p>
    <h2>Learning points</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>HSE/ACAS support was excellent – “prompt support       and encouragement”</li>
      <li>SIP1 activity taking place against a background of       700 redundancies (ca 10%)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Key points</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Prepare and resource properly – the original  Occupational Health Physician who started the process left and was not replaced  – so it can be quite daunting if on your own – you need a team who can be  mutually supportive and who understand the project – otherwise things can grind  to a halt.</li>
      <li>We encourage others to do it – it is an excellent       scheme.</li>
    </ul>
